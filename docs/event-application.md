# Event Application

The event application bot sends an email to the newcubator events mail with the information of the event application form on the homepage.
The bot works in the same way as the contact [request bot](https://gitlab.com/newcubator/micro-bots/-/blob/main/docs/contact-request.md), but with a different form.
